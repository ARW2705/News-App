# News App

Work in Progress

This Angular application utilizes NewsAPI to provide an aggregation of various news articles of the day. The application is intended to practice creating an angular app using a third party API.

## Usage

App is used in conjunction with [News Server](https://github.com/ARW2705/News-Server). After cloning repo, change the base url and api version in shared directory to point to domain of News Server.  Install modules with `npm install`, then run test server with `ng serve`. App can be viewed at `localhost:4200`.
