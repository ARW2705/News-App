of various news articles of the day. The application is
intended to practice creating an angular app using a third
party API.

## Usage

After cloning repo, install modules with `npm install`, then run test server with `ng serve`. App can be viewed at `localhost:4200`. App is used in conjunction with
[News Server](https://github.com/ARW2705/News-Server)
